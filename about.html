    <p style="font-family:Trebuchet MS;font-style:normal">Hi! 👋🏻 I’m Jackie Zuckut and I'm a student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Economics.  I am skilled in frontend, backend, data analysis, and financial modeling, and I’m passionate about software engineering, finance, and sustainability.  Some things I enjoy doing in my free time are hiking, traveling, trying new restaurants, cooking, working out, and listening to music.  Below are some snapshots of places I've been 📷</p>
